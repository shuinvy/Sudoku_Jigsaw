# Sudoku_Jigsaw
It's a Sudoku game, use number puzzle to solve the game.
I create this game by inspiration from https://zh.puzzle-jigsaw-sudoku.com/
It's my second game for practicing making Unity games,
I know there are many places need to be improved in this game,
but I'm poor at making this types of game~

By the way, thanks to tutorial help me learning how to make jigsaw games:
